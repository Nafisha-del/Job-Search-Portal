In addition, they can view list of all jobs, and view list of applicants. The Job Seekers will be able view all available jobs and apply to their preferred jobs. The Admin can display all jobs, job applicants resume, employee accounts, and job seekers accounts. The Admin can also delete jobs and user accounts.
